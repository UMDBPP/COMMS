Communication Over Microwave Mesh

End goal of project is to have complete access to retrive data from and command every payload on the line from a single ground point.

Current design ideology is the use of low power low data rate radios to communicate with a central node that has a "bigger" radio to send all the data to the ground.

Due to size, power and my general insanity radios are being custom designed
